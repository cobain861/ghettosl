COMPARISONS SUPPORTED:

if (v1 == v2) then <command>     v1 is equal to v2
if (v1 != v2) then <command>     v2 is not equal to v2
if (v1 match v2) then <command>  v1 matches regex pattern v2
if (v1 like v2) then <command>   v1 matches wildcard pattern v2


NOTES:

- ( and ) are currently optional (this will probably change)
- && and || can be used, although grouping using ( ) does nothing
- Don't get used to "then". This will be replaced with { }
- < > <= and >= are not yet supported. This will be fixed soon!
- Wildcard matching may not be perfect. Let me know!



EXAMPLE:

set %sim MyFavoriteSim
echo We are going to keep trying until we get to %sim!
tp:
teleport %sim 128 128 20
sleep 10
if ($region != %sim) then goto tp
