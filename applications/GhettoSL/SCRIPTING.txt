
1. Basic command structure
----------------------------

Scripting in ghettoSL consists of a batch-style command sequence.
In addition to the commands listed in /help, there are custom commands
for defining labels and events. Some examples are as follows:

Let's say you want to teleport to a certain region and say "hello".

teleport "Test Region" 128 128 0
label wait
wait 1
if not region "Test Region" goto wait
say hi


The above example initiates a teleport to the sim "Test Region", then
waits for 1 second. If it is not in Test Region yet, it waits another
second, and so on -- until the region name *is* "Test Region".



2. More advanced logic
----------------------------

Obviously, this is not a perfect example. In fact, if your teleport fails,
you could wind up stuck in a loop of waiting. To prevent this, we have
the commands SETTIME and IF ELAPSED. They can be implemented as follows:

label start
settime
teleport "Test Region" 128 128 0
label wait
wait 1
if elapsed 60 goto fail
if not region "Test Region" goto wait
say hi
goto done
label fail
say I coundn't make it to Test Region!
label done


In this improved example, we call "settime" before we teleport. Now each
time we check with "if elapsed 60" it will go to our "fail" label after
60 seconds of retrying. We have added the "done" label so the "fail"
routine is skipped in the event that we made it successfully.



3. Loops and routines
----------------------------

As you can see in the above example, labels can be defined which you can
jump to using the "goto" command. Here is an example of how you could use
a loop to aggressively attempt to connect to a certain region for a
maximum of 10 minutes:

settime
label letsgo
teleport "My Home Region" 128 128 0
wait 15
if elapsed 600 goto giveup
if not region "My Home Region" goto letsgo
im $master I made it!
goto end
label giveup
im $master I couldn't make it for some reason. :(
label end
